<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffuse Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Diffuse Sensors</li><li>Background Suppression Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diffuse sensors market encompasses two primary types: ordinary diffuse sensors and background suppression sensors. Ordinary diffuse sensors detect objects based on light reflection from a surface, suitable for applications where the target object is relatively close and contrasts with the background. In contrast, background suppression sensors utilize advanced technology to specifically focus on the target, ignoring surrounding backgrounds, making them ideal for detecting objects at varying distances and in cluttered environments, thus enhancing reliability in complex applications.</p></p>
