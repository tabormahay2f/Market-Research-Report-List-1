<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NAND Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MLC Type</li><li>TLC Type</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NAND market types primarily include MLC (Multi-Level Cell), TLC (Triple-Level Cell), and other variations. MLC stores two bits per cell, offering a balance of performance and endurance, suitable for consumer applications. TLC increases storage density by holding three bits per cell, making it cost-effective for high-capacity products like SSDs but with reduced endurance. Other types include QLC (Quad-Level Cell) and less common configurations, targeting specific use cases where cost-efficient, high-capacity storage solutions are essential, albeit with further endurance trade-offs.</p></p>
